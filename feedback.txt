Task 1. Very good!
Task 2. Very good!
Task 3. Good and detailed answer in hand-in. Also either one of you implementations
	would pass this task, very good.
Task 4. Very good! Nice to see that you wrote your own mergesort, though the java standard
	collections.sort would be enough. Good answer in hand-in.

Good job! A very clear PASS.
